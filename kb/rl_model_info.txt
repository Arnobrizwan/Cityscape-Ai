Title: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Model Summary – Cityscape-Ai

The Cityscape-Ai system includes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning model trained to optimize urban traffic flow across Kuala Lumpur’s road network.

⸻

Purpose

To reduce overall congestion by intelligently prioritizing road segments (edges) for optimization based on simulated traffic conditions.

⸻

How It Works
	•	Simulates traffic intensity on each road segment.
	•	At each step, the model selects a segment to optimize (e.g., reduce congestion).
	•	Learns over time which segments yield the most improvement when targeted.

⸻

Training Overview
	•	Episodes: 100
	•	State: Simulated traffic levels across all road edges
	•	Action: Choose one edge to optimize
	•	Reward: Negative of total traffic (lower traffic = higher reward)
	•	Goal: Minimize cumulative traffic over time

⸻

Output

A trained policy capable of identifying the most impactful edges to optimize under simulated urban conditions.
