Title: Traffic Optimization Strategies in Cityscape-Ai

Cityscape-Ai applies advanced AI techniques (Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning) to simulate and optimize traffic in Kuala Lumpur. The following strategies guide its decision-making process:

⸻

1. Prioritize High-Traffic Segments

Identify and target road segments (edges) with consistently high simulated traffic volumes. These are prioritized in the RL optimization loop for intervention.

2. Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Policies

The RL agent dynamically adjusts traffic conditions (e.g., signal timing or flow direction) based on real-time reward feedback. This helps in reducing congestion across the network.

3. Target Bottlenecks via Centrality Metrics

Graph centrality (e.g., betweenness) is used to detect and monitor critical intersections. Optimizing these nodes improves overall road network efficiency.

4. GNN-RL Fusion for Smarter Control

Node influence scores from the GNN model are combined with RL policies. This hybrid approach enables more context-aware decision making across spatial regions.

5. Hybrid Control Techniques

Cityscape-Ai supports integrating multiple strategies—such as smart traffic light control, route redirection, and congestion pricing—for layered and adaptive traffic management.
